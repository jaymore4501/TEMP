# 🎨 Collabryx

Collabryx is a real-time, anonymous digital whiteboard built for teams who want to brainstorm and collaborate instantly. No logins, no friction—just create a board, share the link, and start drawing.

Whether you're sketching out a quick idea, building a flowchart, or just chatting with teammates on a shared canvas, Collabryx keeps everything in sync across everyone's screen with zero lag.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

### 1. Clone & Install
Extract the project files and open your terminal:

**Install Frontend:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Install Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Set up Database
You can use a **local MongoDB** instance for development or **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud storage.

- **Local**: Use `mongodb://localhost:27017/collabryx` in your `.env`.
- **Atlas (Production)**:
    1. Create a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
    2. Allow access from "Anywhere" (IP `0.0.0.0/0`) in Network Access.
    3. Create a database user and copy your connection string.

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file inside the `server` folder:
```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Run the App
Open two terminals:

- **Terminal 1 (Backend):** `cd server && npm start`
- **Terminal 2 (Frontend):** `npm run dev`

Open `http://localhost:5173` and you're ready to go!

## 🌐 Deployment

### Backend (Render)
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Create a new "Web Service" on Render.
3. Set root directory to `server`.
4. Build command: `npm install`.
5. Start command: `node src/index.js`.
6. Add your `.env` variables in the settings.

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. Import your repo to Vercel.
2. Add an environment variable: `VITE_API_URL` pointing to your Render URL.
3. Click Deploy!

---

## 🔧 Common Issues

- **"CORS Error"**: Make sure the `CLIENT_URL` in your backend `.env` matches your frontend URL exactly (no trailing slash!).
- **"Database Timeout"**: Double-check that you allowed "Access from Anywhere" in your MongoDB Network settings.
- **"Blurry Export"**: We use 2x scaling, so make sure your browser zoom is set to 100% for the best quality.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **AI-Powered Shapes**: Turn rough sketches into perfect diagrams automatically.
- **Voice Channels**: Built-in voice chat for even faster collaboration.
- **Version History**: A way to see who changed what and when.
- **Mobile Apps**: Dedicated touch-friendly apps for iPad and tablets.
